Regardless of your device (iPhone, iPad, Android, PC, or Mac) you will be able to run your Crystal Reports from anywhere with refreshed data.  Reports have parameters?  No problem!  When the reports are published to Bezlio (as simple putting them in a folder in your network) we dynamically look for parameters and will prompt for them using mobile-friendly inputs.  Once you are viewing the report in Bezlio you can then export it to a variety of formats including Excel and PDF.",

Each warehouse is represented as a container with boxes within for each item in that warehouse.  The larger the box for a given item, the greater the cost associated.  And the color of the box goes from white to red based on relative age.  This clever visualization allows a user to instantly guage and compare the health of warehouses by how 'red' they are and then dig deeper by hovering over the biggest, reddest boxes to find the problems.",
