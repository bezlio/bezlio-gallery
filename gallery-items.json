            "itemDescription": "This Bezl uses a tree map to help visualize both the cost and age of inventory by warehouse into a single view.  Each warehouse is represented as a container with boxes within for each item in that warehouse.  The larger the box for a given item, the greater the cost associated.  And the color of the box goes from white to red based on relative age.  This clever visualization allows a user to instantly guage and compare the health of warehouses by how 'red' they are and then dig deeper by hovering over the biggest, reddest boxes to find the problems.",
