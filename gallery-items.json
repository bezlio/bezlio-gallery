This Bezl has two data subscriptions that can be edited.  First is JobSchedule and this should represent a listing of each job that is currently active on the shop floor.  The required columns are:<br><br><table><tr><td>Location</td><td>Intended to represent some physical location where this job is located for filtering purposes.  This could be a physical location or any other subclassification desired for jobs.</td></tr><tr><td>JobNumber</td><td>The job number.  If you build assemblies you may wish to concatenate the assembly sequence into this column.</td></tr><tr><td>JobDesc</td><td>A text description for the given job.  Typically you might consider putting the finished goods part description here.</td></tr><tr><td>JobNumber</td><td>The job number.  If you build assemblies you may wish to concatenate the assembly sequence into this column.</td></tr><tr><td>CustomerName</td><td>The name of the customer this job is for.</td></tr><tr><td>DueDate</td><td>The due date for the given job operation.  Since a job may have multiple operations, it may also have separate due dates for each.</td></tr><tr><td>WorkCenter</td><td>Similar to Location, this column allows you to categorize your job operations according to the work centers they belong.</td></tr><tr><td>ResourceID</td><td>If the operation is already scheduled to a resource, that ID should be presented here so it shows in the correct column on the dashboard.  If no resource is assigned, leave this field blank.</td></tr><tr><td>ResourceSequence</td><td>If this operation has already been scheduled to a resource, this is the numeric ordering of priority the resource should process this operation in relation to others.  Typical sequencing would be 10,20,30 but any integer values will do.</td></tr><tr><td>ReqQty</td><td>The quantity originally due for this operation.</td></tr><tr><td>CompleteQty</td><td>The quantity already completed at this operation.</td></tr><tr><td>DueToday</td><td>A helper column that gives us a true / falst to know if the operation is due today.  This causes the due date field to show as yellow if true.</td></tr><tr><td>PastDue</td><td>Another helper column to let us know if the given operation is past due.  If this column is true, we show the due date column as red.</td></tr><tr><td>UniqueID</td><td>Some sort of unique value to identify this job and operation row.  In our Excel sample we make this simply the job number concatenated with the JobSequence.</td></tr></table><br><br>The other table this Bezl uses provides the list of available shop resources for assignment to.  The required columns are:<br><br><table><tr><td>Location</td><td>Intended to represent some physical location where this resource is located for filtering purposes.  This could be a physical location or any other subclassification desired for resources.</td></tr><tr><td>ResourceID</td><td>The ID for a given resource.  This should have no spaces.</td></tr><tr><td>ResourceName</td><td>A descriptive name for the resource where spaces are allowed.</td></tr><tr><td>WorkCenter</td><td>Similar to Location, this column allows you to categorize your resources according to the work centers they belong.</td></tr></table><br><br>Since this Bezl also <b>saves</b> data you will need to edit the saveChanges function in the custom designer to match up with your data source."
