# SSRS Report Viewer
The SSRS Report Viewer app will allow you to view your server based SSRS reports from anywhere on any device. Please make sure that you have the latest version of the [SSRS Plugin](https://github.com/bezlio/bezlio-plugins) installed on your BRDB server in order to support all of the features. 
Note: Various features such as parameterized reports and exporting are not currently supported, but you can upvote these as feature requests!
